## **1. Introduction**

This document serves as a comprehensive installation manual for the deployment of **KMS v2.1 (IOS)**. It encompasses both virtualized and physical installation strategies, with a focus on virtual machine deployment via Microsoft Hyper-V. Detailed attention is given to virtual hardware configuration, system initialization, Ubuntu operating system deployment, Docker environment setup, and network configuration.

---

## **2. Deployment Approaches**

KMS v2.1 supports two primary modes of installation:

- **Virtualization via Hyper-V on Windows Operating System**
- **Physical Deployment using a Bootable USB Drive**

These methods provide flexibility depending on the end-user’s infrastructure and deployment preferences.

## **3. Virtual Machine Initialization**

Upon successful acquisition of the `kms_2.1.ios` installation file, initiate the virtualization environment.

- Launch **Hyper-V Manager**.
- Navigate to the `Actions` panel and initiate the creation of a **New Virtual Machine**.

Assign an appropriate **virtual machine name** and specify the preferred **storage location**. Opt for **Generation 2** to ensure compatibility with the required system specifications.

Memory configuration should be manually defined—**dynamic memory allocation must be disabled** to ensure consistent performance.

> 📎 _[Insert image reference: VM Setup and Memory Configuration]_

For network configuration, associate the VM with the **Default Switch** to allow virtual networking. Proceed to allocate **virtual hard disk space**—a **minimum of 500 GB** is mandatory to accommodate the KMS environment and containerized services.

Mount the operating system by selecting the option to install from a **bootable CD/DVD image**, and browse to the `kms_2.1.ios` file to complete this step.

## **4. VM System Settings Configuration**

Once the VM instance is created:

- Access **Settings \> Hardware \> Security**.\
  Disable the **Secure Boot** feature to allow the Ubuntu OS to boot properly.
- Then, navigate to **Settings \> Management \> Checkpoints**.\
  Disable **Enable Checkpoints** to avoid unnecessary snapshot overhead during system updates.

## **5. Operating System Installation (Ubuntu)**

As the system boots, select the installation prompt labeled **"Install KMS Version 3"**. The process may take several minutes.

Upon commencement of the Ubuntu setup:

- Choose **English** as the language preference.
- Select **English (US)** for keyboard layout.
- For installation type, opt to **Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu**.
- Select the appropriate **timezone** corresponding to your region.

> 📎 _[Insert image reference: Language, Keyboard, and Disk Setup]_

During the user setup stage, input the following:

- **Full Name**: [User’s Full Name]
- **Computer Name**: [Hostname for Machine]
- **Username**: [Desired Username]
- **Password**: `Ketsol123$`\
  Ensure the same password is confirmed.

Enable the setting for **automatic login** to streamline subsequent access.

## **6. Post-Installation Terminal Configuration**

After rebooting, navigate to the **Activities menu** and launch the **Terminal (xfce Terminal)**.

To verify Docker functionality and image availability, execute:

```
bash
```

CopyEdit

`sudo docker images `

To update or pull the latest Docker containers:

```
bash
```

CopyEdit

`cd /KMS docker compose pull sudo docker compose pull `

> When prompted, enter the password: `Ketsol123$`

## **7. Network Configuration**

### **Virtual Network Preparation in Hyper-V**

Ensure the following IP configurations are applied within Hyper-V:

- Assign `192.168.100.2` as the IP for **KMS Internal Network**.
- Enable **sharing** on the internal network adapter (Neternet).
- For PLC connectivity, configure the **External Adapter** using the IP address designated for your PLC infrastructure.

> 📎 _[Insert image reference: Hyper-V Network Adapter Settings]_

### **Ubuntu Wired Interface Setup**

On the Ubuntu desktop interface:

- Access the **Network icon** in the top-right corner.
- Choose **Wired Settings** to manage Ethernet interfaces.
- Available adapters such as **eth0**, **eth1**, and **eth2** will be visible. Select the appropriate one for configuration.

> 📎 _[Insert image reference: Wired Network Settings]_

Choose between **Automatic (DHCP)** or **Manual (Static IP)** assignment based on the network policy.

---

## **8. Finalization and System Access**

Upon completion of all prior configurations, the KMS system becomes accessible via:

> [**http://192.168.100.2**](http://192.168.100.2)

Ensure that the system is set to **share the connection** with other devices on the network.
